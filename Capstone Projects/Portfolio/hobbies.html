    "Yoga and gymnastics have been a part of my life since a very young age. I
    have been practising yoga since Third grade. For me, yoga is not just a
    hobby; but a lifestyle. It brings balance, calm and strength in my everyday
    routiene. Also the gym is the one which keeps me fresh and motivated. It's a
    good habit to wake up early and hit gym. A good start to the day results in
    a good day with a fresh and energetic mind."

    "Well these acts as stress busters. The games have always been an escape 
    from stressful situations. Feeling stressed? Bored sitting for hours 
    doing the same work? Just pause for a while and play a game. Well I'm not actually 
    addicted to them but games like BGMI makes me feel connected to my friends
    more closely than just sending memes on instagram."

  <p class="two">"Although some of you might think that it's a job and not a hobby; for 
    me it's been in my intrest since the day I started. Looking up the 
    computers and tech has always fantasized me. I'll be glad if this hobby 
    turns into my job. Looking up to new websites and exploring new features
    and ideas is what seems exciting to me."
